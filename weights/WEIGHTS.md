# U-Net Model Weights

The available weight is for a **U-Net model** trained using satellite imagery as input. 

### Details:
- **Loss Functions**: 
  - Dice Loss
  - Topological clDice Loss (to better capture the connectivity of river networks)
- **Purpose**: Optimized for segmenting and analyzing river networks.

These weights are specifically designed to enhance the model's ability to identify and preserve the structural connectivity of rivers in satellite imagery.

The weights can be downloaded with this link: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gY2lPNDcrQGu5-Hqzlb54rHnCugfm_U2/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gY2lPNDcrQGu5-Hqzlb54rHnCugfm_U2/view?usp=sharing) and should be placed in the `weights/` directory of the project.
